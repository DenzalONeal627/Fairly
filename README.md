# Fairly

Fairly is a SaaS platform enabling talent acquisition teams to quickly find the best talent for their company while saving time on recruiting & hiring.

I was responsible for working on the education requirement form that allowed users to input their information and have jobs associated with users info to populate.

Also worked on building surveys where the system admin views and responds to user inputs/feedback. In that tab it allows for users to select the survey they would like to make inputs to, design questions around it and review the response from the admin.
